The "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game is an engaging and interactive experience that begins by prompting the user to select between rock, paper, or scissors. The input is case-insensitive, and any invalid entries are met with friendly prompts to try again. Simultaneously, the computer makes a random selection from the same options, which remains hidden until the user makes their choice. The game then determines the outcome using the classic rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. If both choices are the same, the round ends in a tie. The results are displayed clearly, showing both the user’s and the computer’s choices alongside the round’s outcome, such as a win, loss, or tie. Optionally, the game tracks scores over multiple rounds, providing a competitive edge by displaying the updated scores after each round. At the end of every round, the user is asked if they would like to play again, allowing them to continue or exit gracefully. The game ensures a smooth and enjoyable experience with clear instructions and feedback throughout.
